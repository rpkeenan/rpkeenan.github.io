								<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
							</header>
							<p>I aim to reveal the processes governing galaxy evolution
								by precisely mapping out the properties and history of the 
								raw material for star formation - cool atomic and molecular 
								gas. I design instruments, carry out surveys, and produce
								models to measure and understand cool gas in galaxies from
								today to the dawn of the universe.</p>

							<p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck
								Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. I completed 
								my graduate studies at the University of Arizona, where I was
								a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, 
								and my undergraduate work at the University of Michigan.</p>

							<p>You can find an overview of my various projects below. I'm
								always happy to chat about any of these topics - send me an 
								email or better yet, if you find yourself in Heidelberg, 
								drop by my office.

							<h3><b>The History of Star Forming Gas</b></h3>
						</header>

						<p>My primary research interest is understanding the processes
							that form and shape galaxies over cosmic time. Clouds cool atomic 
							and molecular hydrogen gas play a particularly significant role
							in this history: cold molecular gas is the precursor to the 
							birth of new stars, while reservoirs of atomic gas surround
							and fill star forming disks and sit at the interface between 
							galaxies and the intergalactic medium. Tracing the properties 
							of this gas will allow us to understand how the barryonic matter 
							has been processed and transformed to create the galaxies we see 
							today.</p>

						<p>Study of molecular gas in the early universe requires
							extremely sensitive millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength
							observations with telescopes such as the Atacama Large
							Millimiter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Because of the long
							observation times required to do this type of research, studies 
							to date have focused on
							extremely small regions of the sky. This may result in sampling
							biases and uncertainties that hinder our understanding. I use
							cosmological simulations to understand the extent of these biases 
							and develop tools to account for them.</p>

						<p>In addition to observing gas in the past, we
							also need to understand its behavior in the present. Many
							properties of molecular gas, such as the relationships between
							different spectral lines that are used to trace its abudnance,
							are poorly understood even in nearby galaxies. To this end, I
							am conducting <a href="amiss.html">a survey</a> of multiple molecular gas spectral lines
							in nearby galaxies to understand how their luminosities correlate
							with one another and various other galaxy properties.</p>

							<h3><b>Line Intensity Mapping</b></h3>
						</header>
						<img src="pictures/im_schematic.png" alt="Schematic illustration of intensity mapping" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; max-width:100%; width:450px;">
						<p>Intensity mapping is a novel tool for studying gas in the
							distant universe. The traditional approach to studying distant
							galaxies has been to select a small number of targets to
							observe in great detail; this provides a wealth of
							information about individual objects, but may miss important
							statistical trends. Line intensity mapping (LIM) allows us to study large
							samples of galaxies, many too faint to be detected in the traditional
							approach, by combining their light statistically. This tool will
							provide complimenatry information to the detailed traditonal
							studies by surveying galaxies over enormous volumes of space.</p>
						<p>I build models to predict the signal that will be seen by LIM 
							surveys at a variety of wavelengths. These models are being used to
							inform instrument design and survey strategy for upcoming LIM 
							projects. I also work on developing data analysis techniques for
							existing and future LIM datasets.</p>
						<p>I am a collaborator in a number of ongoing intensity mapping projects.
							These include the Millimeter Intensity Mapping Experiment
							(mmIME), Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), and 
							the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM).</p>

						<p>As an undergraduate I worked with <a href="http://msoey.astro.lsa.umich.edu/">
							Professor Sally Oey</a> to study
							nearby dwarf galaxies believed to be analogs to some of the
							first star forming galaxies that ionized the early universe. I
							helped develop a tool to identify signatures of powerful bursts
							of star formation that pour intense Lyman continuum light into the
							intergalactic medium. I then applied this tool to pinpoint the
							source of Lyman continuum emission in Haro 11. Our results have
							since been verified by other groups using much more extensive,
							but time consuming, methods.</p>

								<h2><b>Outreach</b></h2>
							</header>
							<p>I am involved in a number of programs that seek to make higher
								education more accessible to groups that have historically
								been underrepresented in academia in general and science in
								particular. Since 2018 I have been a coordinator for
								<a href="http://ireneshivaei.com/mescit">
								Mentorship and Education for SCIence in Tucson (MESCIT)</a>,
								a program that provides math tutoring for high school students
								from Tucson's Native American and refugee communities. My
								primary role is to connect tutors, students, the school
								and benefactors while making sure the tutoring runs smoothly.
								I also collect data about how well our program is working
								and produce reports and recommendations for improvements.

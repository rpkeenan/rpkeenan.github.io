											<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
										</header>
										<p>I am a sixth year graduate student in Astronomy at the
											University of Arizona and a National Science Foundation
											Graduate Research Fellow working with
											<a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/~dmarrone/Home.html">
											Dan Marrone</a> and <a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/people/garrett-k-keating">
											Garrett "Karto" Keating</a>.
											Prior to my time in Arizona, I completed my Undergraduate
											degree in astronomy and physics at the University of
											Michigan.</p>
										<p>I  study galaxy evolution, focusing primarily on the cold,
											dense gas that is required to form new stars. My work
											involves using both observational and theoretical tools to
											understand the evolution of this gas across the history of
											the universe, from only a few hundred million years after
											the big bang up to the present day.</p>
										<p>I am also involved in a number of programs aimed at making
											education and academia more accessbile and diverse. Most
											recently, I have been a coordinator of the Mentorship and
											Education for SCIence in Tucson (MESCIT) program.</p>
										<p>In my free time I like to bake and cook. Since the beginning
											of the COVID-19 pandemic I have set out to recreate taco
											recipes from some of my favorite restaurants in Tucson.
										    Let me know if you want to exchange salsa recipes.</p>

										<h3><b>The History of Star Forming Gas</b></h3>
									</header>
									<p>My primary research interest is understanding the processes
										that form and shape galaxies. Cold gas in the form of molecular
										Hydrogen is thought to be the precursor to the birth of new
										stars. Tracing the properties of this gas will help us to better
										understand how stars formed in galaxies throughout the history
										of the universe, and may provide the key to understanding why
										stars today form at only 10% of the rate that they did when
										the universe was younger.</p>
									<p>Study of molecular gas in the early universe requires
										extremely sensitive millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength
										observations with telescopes such as the Atacama Large
										Millimiter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Because of the long
										observation times required to
										do this type of research, studies to date have focused on
										extremely small regions of the sky. This may result in sampling
										biases and uncertainties that hinder our understanding. I use
										cosmological simulations to understand the extent of these biases 
										and develop tools to account for them.</p>
									<p>In addition to observing molecular gas in the past, we
										also need to understand its behavior in the present. Many
										properties of molecular gas, such as the relationships between
										different spectral lines that are used to trace its abudnance,
										are poorly understood even in nearby galaxies. To this end, I
										am conducting <a href="amiss.html">a survey</a> of multiple molecular gas spectral lines
										in nearby galaxies to understand how their luminosities correlate
										with one another and various other galaxy properties.</p>

										<h3><b>Intensity Mapping</b></h3>
									</header>
									<img src="pictures/im_schematic.png" alt="Schematic illustration of intensity mapping" style="float:right; padding-right:20px; width:450px;">
									<p>Intensity mapping is a novel tool for studying gas in the
										distant universe. The traditional approach to studying distant
										galaxies has been to select a small number of targets to
										observe in great detail; this provides a wealth of
										information about individual objects, but may miss important
										statistical trends. Intensity mapping allows us to study large
										samples of galaxies, many too faint to be detected in the traditional
										approach, by combining their light statistically. This tool will
										provide complimenatry information to the detailed traditonal
										studies by surveying galaxies over enormous volumes of space.</p>
									<p>I have recently worked on combining intensity mapping data from 
										the CO Power Spectrum Survey with spectroscopic redshift
										catalogs for z~3 galaxies in order to constrain the cross power
										spectrum of CO emission and optically selected galaxies. This study
										allowed us to put upper limits on the total molecular gas abundance
										approximately 10 billion years ago.</p>
									<p>I am also a collaborator on a number of ongoing intensity mapping projects.
										These include the Millimeter Intensity Mapping Experiment
										(mmIME; P.I. Karto Keating), which has recently presented a
										detection of the Carbon Monoxide shot power spectrum using ALMA, and
										projects to create state of the art instruments for intensity mapping 
										studies.</p>

									<img src="pictures/haro11.jpg" alt="Haro 11 [OIII]/[OII] Fraction" style="float:left; padding-right:20px; width:450px;">
									<p>As an undergraduate I worked with <a href="http://msoey.astro.lsa.umich.edu/">
										Professor Sally Oey</a> to study
										nearby dwarf galaxies believed to be analogs to some of the
										first star forming galaxies that ionized the early universe. I
										helped develop a tool to identify signatures of powerful bursts
										of star formation that pour intense Lyman continuum light into the
										intergalactic medium. I then applied this tool to pinpoint the
										source of Lyman continuum emission in Haro 11. Our results have
										since been verified by other groups using much more extensive,
										but time consuming, methods.</p>

											<p>I am involved in a number of programs that seek to make higher

												a program that provides math tutoring for high school students

												and benefactors while making sure the tutoring runs smoothly.
												I also collect data about how well our program is working
												and produce reports and recommendations for improvements.
